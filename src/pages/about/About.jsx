          But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain 
          was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of 
          the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes,

          because it is pain, but because occasionally 
          circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example,

          indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment,
